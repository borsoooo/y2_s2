                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Orsolya Holló</strong>, originally from Hungary and currently living in the Netherlands for almost two years. I’m studying <strong>Creative Business</strong> at <strong>Breda University of Applied Sciences</strong>, a program that perfectly blends the two things I’m most passionate about: <strong>creativity and marketing</strong>.</p>
                    <p>My heart beats for <strong>marketing</strong>—especially when it connects with my other lifelong love: <strong>sports</strong>. I’ve played <strong>handball for nearly 12 years</strong> and still play today, however not on a professional level anymore. I’ve also did athletics, basketball, football, and volleyball—because standing still just isn’t in my nature.</p>
                    <p>Beyond sports and studies, I’m someone who thrives on <strong>being productive</strong>. I currently have <strong>four side jobs</strong>, and while that might sound intense, it reflects who I am: hardworking, disciplined, and driven. I grew up watching my parents work incredibly hard to give me and my siblings the best opportunities—and I’ve carried that work ethic with me ever since.</p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>I come from one of the <strong>poorest regions of Hungary</strong>, from a tiny village with <strong>less than 300 people</strong>. We didn’t have an elementary school there, so I traveled to a nearby village each day to attend school. After that, I continued my studies at <strong>Zrínyi Ilona High School in Miskolc</strong>, where I followed a <strong>bilingual English program</strong>.</p>
                <p>From early on, I knew that <strong>learning English was my way out</strong>—my key to something bigger. My dream was to study abroad, and I worked hard during high school to make that dream a reality. That was the time I made the tough decision to <strong>quit handball</strong>, in order to focus on my grades and part-time work to save money.</p>
                <p>I graduated with one of the <strong>best grades in my class</strong>, and earned both <strong>academic and sports honors</strong>. In 2023, I took the biggest step of my life so far and moved to the <strong>Netherlands</strong> to begin my studies at <strong>Breda University of Applied Sciences</strong>.</p>
                <p>That move changed everything. My life did a full <strong>180-degree turn</strong>, and I’ve grown so much since—personally, academically, and emotionally. I’m proud of where I come from, and even prouder of how far I’ve come.</p>
